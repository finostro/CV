              equivalent or superior SLAM performance to state-of-the-art
              solutions, under varying odometry, spatial and detection
              measurement uncertainties, without reliance on data association
              decisions. Results are based on both simulations and the
              challenging EuRoC data set, in which a drone undergoing high
              accelerations, equipped with a stereo camera, performs SLAM. Since
              JVS-SLAM jointly provides a solution to the map feature to
              measurement association problem, its computational complexity is
              comparable with multi-hypothesis based solutions. Parallels between
              state-of-the-art map management and feature to measurement
              association methods and the detection statistics used within
              JVS-SLAM will be examined, with a view to reducing its complexity

  abstract = {Abstract Automation of machines in underground mines is a topic
              with increasing interest, both for research and industrial
              applications. Autonomous load–haul–dump (LHD) machines need to load
              material successfully before dumping it into a crusher or an ore
              pass. The autonomous loading method must be robust to enable
              reliable operation of the LHD during long periods of time. In this
              work, a method to perform autonomous loading in Room \& Pillar
              mines is presented. It is based on detecting all ore piles in
              real-time, and then computing attack poses in each pile. Then, a
              positioning process is performed to get the machine in front of the
              selected ore pile, and an excavation algorithm is executed for
              loading until the bucket is filled. The proposed method is able to
              detect multiple ore piles, with different slopes and sizes, and to
              consider different possible trajectories for attacking and loading
              the most feasible pile. The method was tested in the Werra Potash
              Mine, under real operational conditions. The results show that the
              method can load about 80\% of the material that an experienced
              operator can load. Also, the success rate of the autonomous loading
              process is very high, being able to load enough material in all
              trials, and performing successfully the full procedure in 88\% of
              the cases. Thus, the proposed autonomous loading method is a
              suitable alternative to be used in Room \& Pillar mines.},

              measurements that a detector utilizes to generate a detection as
              its descriptor. This one dimensional descriptor can be calculated
              with many range-based detectors, and its expected value is used to
              derive detection statistics which take into account feature
              occlusions to improve robotic navigation performance. To
              demonstrate the advantages of estimating detection statistics, they
              are estimated and tested within Random Finite Set and vector-based
              Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Results
              from simulations and real experiments demonstrate the advantages of
              explicitly modeling feature detection statistics in both

  ABSTRACT = {Under realistic environmental conditions, heuristic-based data
              association and map management routines often result in divergent
              map and trajectory estimates in robotic Simultaneous Localization
              And Mapping (SLAM). To address these issues, SLAM solutions have
              been proposed based on the Random Finite Set (RFS) framework, which
              models the map and measurements such that the usual requirements of
              external data association routines and map management heuristics
              can be circumvented and realistic sensor detection uncertainty can
              be taken into account. Rao&ndash;Blackwellized particle filter
              (RBPF)-based RFS SLAM solutions have been demonstrated using the
              Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter and subsequently the
              Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter. In multi-target tracking, the
              LMB filter, which was introduced as an efficient approximation to
              the computationally expensive &delta; -Generalized LMB ( &delta;
              -GLMB) filter, converts its representation of an LMB distribution
              to &delta; -GLMB form during the measurement update step. This not
              only results in a loss of information yielding inferior results
              (compared to the &delta; -GLMB filter) but also fails to take
              computational advantages in parallelized implementations possible
              with RBPF-based SLAM algorithms. Similar to state-of-the-art random
              vector-valued RBPF solutions such as FastSLAM and MH-FastSLAM, the
              performances of all RBPF-based SLAM algorithms based on the RFS
              framework also diverge from ground truth over time due to random
              sampling approaches, which only rely on control noise variance.
              Further, the methods lose particle diversity and diverge over time
              as a result of particle degeneracy. To alleviate this problem and
              further improve the quality of map estimates, a SLAM solution using
              an optimal kernel-based particle filter combined with an efficient
              variant of the &delta; -GLMB filter ( &delta; -GLMB-SLAM) is
              presented. The performance of the proposed &delta; -GLMB-SLAM
              algorithm, referred to as &delta; -GLMB-SLAM2.0, was demonstrated
              using simulated datasets and a section of the publicly available
              KITTI dataset. The results suggest that even with a limited number
              of particles, &delta; -GLMB-SLAM2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art
              RBPF-based RFS SLAM algorithms.},
