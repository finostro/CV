#cvSection("Profile")

	I'm a robotics engineer with a PhD in Electrical Engineering. My interests are Robotics, Autonomous Vehicles, robotic mapping and localization (SLAM) and sensor data processing in general.
	I am capable of designing and implementing robotic systems to solve real world applications. I can do work like choosing which sensors to use, or  writing the low level code required to process them, all the way to choosing which navigation algorithms to best control a mobile robot.

	My strong background in robotics has given me experience with writing and debugging code in C++, Python and ROS (both 1 and 2) as well as keeping track of it in Git.
	This experience has also allowed me to work with Linux and its multiple systems.
	Also as during my PhD I worked with an advisor who was a native English speaker, I was able to write my thesis in English and learned to communicate technical information efficiently in that language
